This implies that selecting multiple resources via dragging the mouse on the timeline is not possible.\n\n\nYou can create events via the \"events\" feeds which are associated with multiple resources (see https://fullcalendar.io/docs/resource_data/associating_events/) but it's not supported via the UI yet.\n\nYou'd have to create your own UI to allow the user to specify this, and/or put in a feature request to the maintainer to add this support in future (it may already be on the roadmap, I haven't looked).\n\n",

			"content": "Without more information, it's impossible to pinpoint the exact cause of the problem you're experiencing, although it's conceivable that the problem is connected to the way your code handles touch events.\n\nYour code is probably adjusting the value of state.index depending on the gesture when you swipe between screens, and then refreshing the screen display based on the value of state.index. The screen display may update twice if state.index is being updated by reference because the value is being modified twice: once by the gesture and once by the setWtf function.\n\nUsing a different variable to hold the current screen index and only updating the value of state.index when the user interacts with the buttons is one potential fix for this problem. This should prevent the screen from being displayed more more once and ensure that the value of state.index is only modified once.\n\nIt's important to keep in mind that the setWtf function you specified in your query could not be connected to the problem you're having. Without more information, it's difficult to say for sure whether this function is being used to update another state in your application.",
